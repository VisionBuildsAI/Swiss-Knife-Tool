# Swiss Knife Tool
“One tool to break, make, encrypt, decode, analyze, and dominate.”

Welcome to your personal cyber-operations console.
This tool isn’t some cute Python project — it’s a modular digital weapon designed for encryption, brute-forcing, text analysis, and offensive/defensive experiments (all legal & ethical, chill).

UI runs in a hacker-themed terminal-style GUI — dark, minimal, intimidating.



## Features

✔ AES-grade encryption & decryption

✔ Caesar Cipher encoder/decoder

✔ Brute-force Caesar solver (cracks all shifts in seconds)

✔ Text Intel Module → length, frequencies, entropy-like stats

✔ “Terminal Mode GUI” (green-on-black aesthetic)

✔ Modular architecture → add your own cyber modules easily

✔ Built for devs, learners, script kiddies turning pro 😈
## Tech Stack

Python 3.x

Tkinter (terminal-themed UI)

Cryptography library

Custom-built algorithms

Expandable modules system
